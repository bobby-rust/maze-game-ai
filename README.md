- (Q) Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
- (A) In this project, we were given code to allow us to focus on the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm.
  We were given a GameExperience module and a TreasureMaze module. The GameExperience implements the model's
  experience, such as remembering episodes, retrieving experience data and predicting actions based on experiences.
  The TreasureMaze module implements the game's environment using a grid. The grid contains open cells, blocked cells,
  and the location of the treasure and agent. It has helper functions to retrieve valid moves based on its current state,
  draw the maze to a canvas, act on the state, get rewards based on the state and observe the state. We were also given code
  to build the model and it was our responsibility to implement the Q-training algorithm.
- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  - (Q) What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  - (A) Computer science is a broad field that encompasses many subjects. Computer scientists research and implement
    cutting-edge technology to advance our society. Computer science has brought a huge increase in efficiency
    through automation, such as robots in factories, software to perform mundane tasks, and most recently, advances
    in AI for self-driving cars, and generative AI that can output natural language, code, and even videos and images.
    Computer science has even helped the healthcare industry by making healthcare more accessible, and research is ongoing
    for using AI to diagnose patients with accuracy, helping to lower the cost of healthcare and increase the accessibility
    of healthcare in less fortunate countries.
  - (Q) How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  - (A) As a computer scientist, I have been trained through both education and personal experience to break down problems
    into smaller sub-problems that are more easily solved. Mental bandwidth is not an unlimited resource, so the less we have to
    focus on at once, the more easily we will be able to solve problems. These problems then come together to solve much bigger
    problems that may have once seemed impossible. During this process, we recognize patterns from previous experiences
    that can be applied to the problem. In many cases, some of the subproblems will already have been solved by someone previously,
    and thanks to the internet, this information might be available to be found and accessed by anyone.
  - (Q) What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  - (A) As a software engineer, I have an ethical responsibility to ensure that software continues to work for the benefit
    of humanity. In some cases, I may find myself in a position where the software I write can cause great harm if implemented
    incorrectly, which has happened many times in the past. I have a responsibility to maintain the privacy and security
    of the end-user and follow any applicable laws and regulations that may apply.
